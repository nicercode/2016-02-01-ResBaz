Expectations

- not an R workshop
- not software engineering
- not going to turn people into crack programmers and solve all their problems
- tools vs concepts: emphasising concepts
- brief tour through some useful concepts and ideas that are not widely used in academic programmers
- diverse crowd: not everything will appeal to everyone.  Some material will seem old or new, useful or useless, but bear with us.

Setup

- pairs
- stickies
