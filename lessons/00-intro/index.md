Expectations

- not an R workshop
- not software engineering
- not going to turn people into crack programmers and solve all their problems
- tools vs concepts: emphasising concepts
- brief tour through some useful concepts and ideas that are not widely used in academic programmers
- diverse crowd: not everything will appeal to everyone.  Some material will seem old or new, useful or useless, but bear with us.

Setup

- pairs
- stickies

Hype

- anyone can code: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYZF6oIZtfc&list=PLzdnOPI1iJNe1WmdkMG-Ca8cLQpdEAL7Q
- Obama asks you to learn to code: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XvmhE1J9PY&list=PLzdnOPI1iJNe1WmdkMG-Ca8cLQpdEAL7Q
- code, the new literacy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwLXrN0Yguk&list=PLzdnOPI1iJNe1WmdkMG-Ca8cLQpdEAL7Q
- what most schools don't teach: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKIu9yen5nc&feature=c4-overview-vl&list=PLzdnOPI1iJNe1WmdkMG-Ca8cLQpdEAL7Q

The problem

- the big mess
