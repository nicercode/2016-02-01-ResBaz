## Why are we here?

Why are you here?

Why am I here?

<!-- Hype

[Software carpentry](http://www.software-carpentry.org/)

- **Mission**: [Software Carpentry] helps researchers be more productive by teaching them basic computing skills. We run boot camps at dozens of sites around the world, and also provide open access material online for self-paced instruction. The benefits are more reliable results and higher productivity: a day a week is common, and a ten-fold improvement isn't rare.
- **Who we are:** Software Carpentry is a volunteer organization supported by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation and the Mozilla Foundation.
- **Boot camps:** Our boot camps cover the core skills every scientist needs to get more done in less time: program construction, version control, testing, the command line, and data management. Short lessons alternate with hands-on practical sessions for two full days

This boot camp sponsored by Andrew Letten, thanks Andrew!

## The problem

- the big mess

## The solution

In this bootcamp you will learn how to

- structure projects
- write functions
- apply these functions to your code, making it more reliable and readable, and also saving you time
- test your functions so that you are sure they are doing what you think they are
- make your work more transparent and reproducible
- collaborate more effectively.

Going to use R language

- whose used R before: <6 months, up to 2 years, more than 2 years

## Expectations

- we are volunteers
	- not being paid
	- we are also learning
- this boot camp is not
	- an R workshop
	- software engineering
	- going to turn people into crack programmers and solve all their problems
- It is
	- about concepts not tools
	- brief tour through some useful concepts and ideas that are not widely used in academic programmers
- no silver bullet
	- hoping that after two days you'll write perfect code, you won't. We **will** show you the key ingredients
	- after that
- boot camp is inclusive
	- diverse crowd: not everything will appeal to everyone.  Some material will seem old or new, useful or useless, but bear with us.
	- there is no dumb question
	- anti-social behaviour not welcome
	- everyone has complimentary skills --> use these to help each other

## Setup

- Sticky notes for help
- Rstudio & Etherpad to share notes: [https://etherpad.mozilla.org/SWC-Syd](https://etherpad.mozilla.org/SWC-Syd) (check with sticky notes)
- Work in pairs
	- why?
	- help each other: Peer to peer is most efficient way of learning.
