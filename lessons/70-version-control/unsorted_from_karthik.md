**Commonly used Git commands**  

* `git init` (will initialize a new Git repository inside a folder. It * also affects all files and subfolders within. Only required once per * project. Projects are managed at a folder level. Do not nest Git projects inside each other).

* `git status` (will show you the current state of the repository. * You'll use this all the time).

* `git show-branch` (see recent commits from branches).

* `git checkout` (switch branches, or grab files from earlier commits).

* `git add` (stage files ready for committing).  
* `git commit` (commit files into Git's memory with a useful message).  
* `git branch` (list branches, create them or delete existing ones).  
* `git push` (sync changes with a remote repository).  
* `git pull` (sync changes from a remote to a local repository).  
* `git merge` (merge changes between branches).  
* `git diff` (show changes between current file and most recent commit)* .
* `git log` (see detailed logs. Using the aliases defined above, you can see shorter one-line logs and also branch activity).

There are many more commands in Git but if you master this set it should serve you well for a long time.

**Practicing Git branching**
[http://pcottle.github.io/learnGitBranching/?NODEMO](http://pcottle.github.io/learnGitBranching/?NODEMO)
In the demo you won't have to add files so just go on comitting. Remove ?NODEMO if you want more instructions. It's a great resource for both beginners and advanced users.
