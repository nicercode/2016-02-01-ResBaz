**Cue:**

* [git branching](http://pcottle.github.io/learnGitBranching/?NODEMO)

A linear history is fine, but that is often not how science progresses.

Suppose that you've got your project working, but want to get tidy it up a bit in a way that requires major surgery and you want to be able to get back to where you were.

Alternatively, suppose that you want to try two different ways of implementing something.

In my case, I have a package that I mantain -- sometimes I need to add bug fixes to the released version without wanting to publish the broken development code.

What if you wanted to go back to an old version and continue development from there?

In all of these scenarios, we might want to work on a "branch" of the project.

## What do branches look like?

Suppose that we have a repository with three commits: `C0`, `C1` and `C2`:

![](img/pro-git-branch-base.png)

at the moment there is only one branch: "`master`".  Now imagine that
we're going to do some work starting at this point -- we'll create a
new branch that starts from our current point (`C2`), in this case
called `iss53` (the diagrams come from the excellent
[Pro Git](http://git-scm.com/book) book, and I've not redrawn them --
for an ecologist this might be "experiment" or "reorganise_data").

![](img/pro-git-branch-just-branched.png)

We then continue to do work on this new branch:

![](img/pro-git-branch-extend.png)

At this point, we might be happy with the new work and just want to
merge the branches back together (moving the `master` pointer up to
`C3`).  

Alternatively, you might have to do some work on `master` (perhaps
your supervisor needs you to tweak a figure for a talk they are giving
*right now*, but your current state on `iss53` would break it).  You
could then switch back to branch `master` and do some more work there
too:

![](img/pro-git-branch-split.png)

(Note that the `iss53` branch has been renamed `experiment` here!)
Now you your history has diverged -- both commits `C3` and `C4` have
`C2` as a parent, but they consist of different work.  You have a
choice of how you want to resolve the diverge this to get the work
done on `C3` and `C4` onto the same branch.  First you can **merge**
the changes together:

![](img/pro-git-branch-merge.png)

this means that `C5` has two parents (`C3` and `C4`) and that it
includes the content of both.

Alternatively there is a strategy called **rebase** where we would
replay the changes on the `experiment` branch on the `master` branch,
which gives a linear history:

![](img/pro-git-branch-rebase.png)

What this does is to look at the difference between `C3` and `C2`, and
then apply that difference to `C4` so that the new commit `C3'`
contains the results of `C4` and `C3`.  The old `C3` commit is then
dropped.

Note that the **contents** of `C3'` and `C5` will likely be the same
at the end of these two operations -- the difference is in the
interpretation of how they came into being.

## Workflows that use branches

Branches most naturally appear in a project that is simultaneously
being worked on by different people.  It turns out the git will see
branches in someone else's repository essentially like branches in
your own, and lots of cool ways of working with branches become
possible.

They also are important for single-user workflows.  I use them for
testing ideas that I'm not sure about:

* Create a branch
* Commit a bunch of work to it
* Decide if I like the work and if so...
* Merge it back into the main branch

This idea is nicely formalised in
[this flow chart](http://nakedstartup.com/2010/04/simple-daily-git-workflow).


![](img/git-branch-simple.png)

Much more complicated (but powerful in the right hands) workflows are
possible, such as the so-called
[git-flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)
workflow.

## Listing branches

The command `git branch` lists the branches git knows about.  By
default, there is only one branch and it is called `master`.

```
git branch
* master
```

The asterisk next to this indicates that this is the *current* branch.
If you pass in the `-v` argument (for **verbose**), you get

```
git branch -v
* master a0f9f69 Added RStudio files
```

which adds the shortened version of the SHA hash and the last commit
message.

## Creating branches

There are two ways of creating branches in git.  The first is to use
`git branch`.  The command 

```
git branch new_idea
```

creates a new branch called `new_idea`, but does not change to it.
Rerunning `git branch -v`:

```
* master   a0f9f69 Added RStudio files
  new_idea a0f9f69 Added RStudio files
```

We now have two branches, both at the same point on the tree.  The
asterisk indicates that we are on the branch `master`.

You can change to a branch by using `git checkout`.  So to switch to
the `new_idea` branch, you would do:

```
git checkout new_idea
```

which lets you know that it worked

```
Switched to branch 'new_idea'
```

You can switch back to master by doing

```
git checkout master
Switched to branch 'master'
```

and can delete branches by passing `-d` to `git branch`

```
git branch -d new_idea
```

which prints

```
Deleted branch new_idea (was a0f9f69).
```

The other way of creating a branch and switching to it is to pass `-b`
as an argument to checkout:

```
git checkout -b new_idea
Switched to a new branch 'new_idea'
```

Now `git branch` shows:

```
  master
* new_idea
```

as we both *created* and *switched to* the new branch `new_idea`.

## How branches grow

New work is commited to the current active branch (the one with the
asterisk next to it in `git branch` (at the moment this is the branch
`new_idea`.  So if we edit a file and do `git commit`.

```
# ...edit file...
git add script.R
git commit -m "Modified function to make NA treatment optional"
```

The history is now equivalent to this picture from before:

![](img/pro-git-branch-extend.png)

You can also see a picture of this with some arguments to `git log`:

```
git log --graph --decorate --pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit
* 37485b1 (HEAD, new_idea) Modified function to make NA treatment optional
* a0f9f69 (master) Added RStudio files
* 9b5f828 Added function that computes standard error of the mean
```

(which will even be in colour if you [set that up](setup.html#Colour))

## Merging branches back together

Suppose that you are happy with the changes that you made and want to
merge them into your `master` branch.

To do the merge, you first check the `master` branch back out:

```
git checkout master
```

which will output

```
Switched to branch 'master'
```

then

```
git merge new_idea
```

which will output

```
Updating a0f9f69..37485b1
Fast-forward
 script.R | 3 +-
 1 file changed, 3 insertions(+), 2 deletions(-)
```

telling you that `master` was "fast-forwarded" from `a0f9f69` to
`37485b1`, changing one file (`script.R`) by inserting three lines and
deleting two.

The tree now has two branches that "point" at the last commit:
`master` and `new_idea`.  We can delete the `new_idea` branch with

```
git branch -d new_idea
```

(the `-d` argument stands for **delete**).

## Merging when branches have diverged

If you have a history like this one:

![](img/pro-git-branch-split.png)

as noted above you have two choices -- you can **merge** or you can
**rebase**.  Suppose for now that we have checked out `experiment`.
You would switch to to branch `master` by running

```
git checkout master
```

and then merge the experiment in with

```
git merge experiment
```

which gives a history like this:

![](img/pro-git-branch-merge.png)

The alternative would be to run 
```
git checkout master
git rebase experiment
```

which results in a history like this:

![](img/pro-git-branch-rebase.png)

In both cases, you could delete the experiment branch with

```
git branch -d experiment
```

What you chose is often mostly a matter of taste (and there are a
diversity of opinions on this).  For a single-user workflow it often
does not make much difference.

Sometimes, the change on a branch all falls in a logical chunk, and it
might make good sense to merge that in with `merge` to reflect this in
your history.  Other times, the different branches just reflect
working on different computers, or changes that make sense when
reordered linearly.  In that case, `rebase` is often the best bet.

## Branches and old versions

Suppose that you want to look an old version (say, `C2` in the graphs
above).  You can simply do to

```
git checkout C2
```

which will produce the rather scary message:

```
You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -b with the checkout command again. Example:

  git checkout -b new_branch_name

HEAD is now at 5d522e6... Added RStudio files
```

![](img/headless-mode.jpg)

What this means:
 - you can't commit anything
 - any changes you make will be lost when you go back to a "proper" branch.
 
If you did want to start a branch here, you can do 

```
git checkout -b revisit_old_analysis
```

which will start a new branch at the point `C2`.  You can then
continue adding to that branch with `git commit`, or just easily
switch back to it.

You could also have done both things in one step, from `master`:

```
git checkout -b revisit_old_analysis C2
```

which would start a new branch called `revisit_old_analysis` at the
point in history `C2`.

## Concluding remarks

Branching is git's "killer feature" -- the thing that it does better
than most other version control systems.  Branches are addictive, and
once you get used to using them, you'll find all sorts of use for
them.  Branches are very fast to create, to switch between, and to
destroy.  If they help you structure your work, you should use them!

There is an incredible
[Git branching demo](http://pcottle.github.io/learnGitBranching/?NODEMO)
that is useful to work through learning about git branches.  It also has a
[tutorial mode](http://pcottle.github.io/learnGitBranching/) with lots
of lessons.
