There is no way that we can cover everything that you need to get started with git.  I recommend that you work through the first two chapters of the [git book](http://git-scm.org/book) (free and online!).  It won't take long and you can skim through sections.  This is 95% of what you need to know to use git by yourself.  If you read the third chapter you know 99% of what you need to use git in a collaborative team.

There are some good online tutorials online; these two might be of particular interest [this one](http://kbroman.github.io/github_tutorial/) focusses on using git with github and [this one](http://karthik.github.io/git_intro/) gives a nice bit of extra motivation.

[Here](http://nicercode.github.io/git/) is a beginner-focussed tutorial we use in another course that focusses on using git from within R.

[GitHub](http:/github.com) is amazing and makes it easy to do a lot with git.  In particular it makes it easy to
* see [diffs](https://github.com/dfalster/Revolve/compare/master%40%7B10day%7D...master), comparing different versions of your project easily, and without having to remember the command syntax.
* examine [logs](https://github.com/dfalster/Revolve/commits/master/R/utils.R) so you can see what happened by file, or over the whole project.
* use [blame](https://github.com/richfitz/diversitree/blame/master/diversitree/R/model-pgls.R) to see who changed what line in a file and when.
* to help [collaborate](https://github.com/dfalster/Revolve/commits/master) with other people on code.
* use ["pull requests"](https://github.com/richfitz/diversitree/pull/2), which mean you can easily contribute to other people's projects and they can easily control what is added to their project.
* set up [continuous integration](https://travis-ci.org/richfitz/forest), so that you know as soon as something goes wrong.

[bitbucket](http://bitbucket.org) is much the same, and both offer educational accounts.

If you don't like git, you might like [Mercurial](mercurial.selenic.com).  If that doesn't do it for you, there are [many, many others](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_revision_control_software) but bear in mind that it's important to use similar systems to people you might work with.
